# gwyf-hack (A hack for the game "Golf With Your Friends")


* Features
  - `modifying the stroke counter` Allows you to increase/decrease the current stroke counter
  - `airstuck` Allows you to instantly freeze the ball in air (works on ground as well)
  - `walkmode` Allows you to freely move the ball without having to do strokes, the mouse works as some kind of "gas pedal"
  - `teleport` Allows you to instantly teleport to the hole
  
* Remarks
  - You got to inject the hack at the main menu, otherwise it won't work
  - I wrote this hack months ago when I didn't have that much time, I didn't care about good coding practices, even the underlying concept is very "hacky" and considered "bad"
  - I'm not going to update this repository, neither am I going to fix possible bugs. Consider this repository as a proof of concept
